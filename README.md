Roman numerals don't have number zero.

Symbols are placed from left to right in order of value, starting with the largest. However to avoid four characters being repeated in succession, subtractive notation is often used as follows:
- I placed before V or X indicates 1 less, so 4 is IV and 9 is IX 
- X placed before L or C indicates 10 less, so 40 is XL and 90 is XC 
- C placed before D or M indicates 100 less, so 400 is CD and nine hundred is CM

For example, MCMIV is 1904.
